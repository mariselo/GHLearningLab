# Welcome, this is the repository for your Learning Lab course

Welcome to **your** repository for this GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through. 

Oh! I haven't introduced myself...

I'm the GitHub Learning Lab bot and I'm here to help guide you in your journey to learn and master the various topics covered in this course. I will be using Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with you. In fact, I already started communicating with you there. Check it out! Click on the issue or pull request tab at the top of your repository to begin.
